Welcome to the official repository for the *Automotive Door Trim Panel* design and development project. This project showcases a comprehensive engineering study and development process for a vehicle interior component—specifically, the door trim panel—integrating aesthetics, functionality, manufacturability, and safety considerations.

## Overview

This project demonstrates the end-to-end approach followed in the *design and development of an automotive interior door trim panel*, beginning from initial concept generation and benchmarking to 3D CAD design, material selection, and manufacturability review.

## Key Features

- *Benchmarking* of existing door trims to derive product specifications
- *Material selection* based on functional requirements and cost optimization
- *Class A surface analysis* and feasibility study
- *3D modeling in CATIA V5* covering main door panel and sub-components
- *DFM (Design for Manufacturing)* and DFA (Design for Assembly) principles
- *Cost analysis* and estimated Bill of Materials (BoM)
- *Engineering drawings* with GD&T annotations

## Tools & Technologies Used

- *CAD Software*: CATIA V5
- *Documentation*: MS Word, PDF
- *Analysis*: Manual feasibility checks, DFM/DFA considerations

## Deliverables

- Final PDF report (Automotive_Door_Trim_Panel_Project_Report.pdf)
- CAD models and technical drawings (not included in this repo; available upon request)
